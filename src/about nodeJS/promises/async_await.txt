- async/await is a syntactical sugar for promises. It makes the code more readable and maintainable.

- async is wriiten before a function & denotes that the function works asynchronously.
    eg: const add = async() =>{
        //function body
    }

- await is written before a task and waits for the promise to get resolved. After promise is resolved it stores the value in given variable.
    eg: const data = await getData()

- ERROR HANDLING:
     we CANNOT use catch functions directly with async/await, so we use try/catch.

     eg:

     const func = async()=>{
         try{
             const data = await getData();
         }
         catch (err){
             //handle error
         }
     }
