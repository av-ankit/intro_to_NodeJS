- REST = Respresentational State Transfer

- www.somewebsite.com/getUsers
--------------------- --------
        URL           endpoint

- Endpoint should not have a verb.
eg: getUser //wrong
    users   //acceptable

- REST API should be stateless.
- Stateless = all state is handled on the client side.
means: each request must contain all the info necessary to process a (next) certain request. The server should not have to remember the previous state.
