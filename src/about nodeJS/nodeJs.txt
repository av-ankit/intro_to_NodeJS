- NodeJS is a "run-time-environment".
    meaning: now we can use javascript outside any browser.

- Built on Chorme's V8 Engine + C++.
    meaning: to run javascript we have javascript engines in our browser but to run the javascript in nodejs V8 engine is used.

- NodeJs is basically javascript running on server.

- Acts as a backend.

- Has package ecosystem = NPM (largest ecosystem of open-source libs)

- Non-Blocking I/O.

- Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

- NodeJS works asynchronously by using philosophy of callbacks.
    It calls the callback functions as soon as the operation being executed is finished!

- Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
------------------------------------------------
1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.
2. Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
3. Returns the content to the client.
4. Ready to handle the next request.

3. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client (this is done asynchronously with the help of callback functions)
