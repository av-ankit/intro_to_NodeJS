- Node works on event driven architecture.

- Event is Emmited by Node
- Event is listened 
- Callbacks are triggered to handle the event

eg: http module 
        create server -> req recieved -> callback fired


- Events are called in order they are declared

- .emit() emits event & .on() listens to the event
