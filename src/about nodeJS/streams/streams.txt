______________________
Types of Streams:

1. Readble Streams: 
    events = data,end
    functions = pipe() {plug streams together}, read()

2. Writable Streams:
    events =  drain , finish
    functions = write(), end()

3. Duplex Streams: readbale + writable

4. Transform Streams: duplex streams with moidification to data
