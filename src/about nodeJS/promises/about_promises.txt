- Promises = a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code.

- Promise Stages:
    a. Pending = (undefined)
    b. Resolved = (result value)
    c. Rejected = (error object)

- .then() = handles resolved promise (only result value)
- .catch() = handles rejected promise (error object)

* above both are callback functions

- .then((res)=>{
    does the next operation
})
